rcsi gives information on files maintained by the RCS Revision Control
System. Output is similar to this:

<p>

<table>
<tr><td>cmb.rcsi > rcsi					</td></tr>
<tr><td>COPYING  </td><td>( out, unchanged, unlocked )	</td></tr>
<tr><td>Makefile </td><td>( out, *revised*,  cmb:1.5 )	</td></tr>
<tr><td>RCS      </td><td>( Directory )			</td></tr>
<tr><td>README   </td><td>( out, unchanged, unlocked )	</td></tr>
<tr><td>README~  </td><td>( Not under RCS )		</td></tr>
<tr><td>rcsi     </td><td>( Not under RCS )		</td></tr>
<tr><td>rcsi-0.1 </td><td>( Directory )			</td></tr>
<tr><td>rcsi.c   </td><td>( out, *revised*,  cmb:1.10 )	</td></tr>
<tr><td>cmb.rcsi > 					</td></tr>
</table>

<p>

You may also specify files on the command line:

<p>

<table>
<tr><td>cmb.rcsi > rcsi COPYING README rcsi.c		</td></tr>
<tr><td>COPYING  </td><td>( out, unchanged, unlocked )	</td></tr>
<tr><td>README   </td><td>( out, unchanged, unlocked )	</td></tr>
<tr><td>rcsi.c   </td><td>( out, *revised*,  cmb:1.10 )	</td></tr>
<tr><td>cmb.rcsi > 					</td></tr>
</table>

<p>

<table border align=center>
<tr>
	<td><b>Example 1</b></td><td><b>Example 2</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><img src="example1.png"></td>
	<td><img src="example2.png"></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>

A numer of options are available to limit the output, for example only
to changed files, or only files with locks.

<p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

Just type 'make' - by default 'gcc' is used. Then copy the binary and
the man page to wherever you want them to go... Edit the Makefile if
you need to use a different compiler or compile time options. 'rcsi'
was developed and tested principally on Linux (originally Slackware
release 2.0, and most recently Mandrake 9.0), and has also been
compiled and run on SunOS 4.1.3, Solaris 2.3, Irix 5.2 and OSF/1 - see
the Makefile for example targets for the different architectures.

<p>

<h2>Status and Bug Reports</h2>

'rcsi' is in some ways rough and ready, but has done the job for me
since around 1994 with few bugs. I am aware of no current bugs - just
clunkiness of design! If you find any bugs, please let me know. Also,
if you have any suggestions for information that 'rcsi' could display
that you would find useful, I'd be interested in hearing them.

Contact <a href="mailto:Colin.Brough@blueyonder.co.uk">me</a> with
comments, bug reports, etc.

<p>

I'll generally try and make the most recent version of rcsi available
as a gzipped tar file from:

<p>

<a href="http://www.colinbrough.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/rcsi-0.5.tar.gz">Download
rcsi 0.5</a>
</center>

<p>

(or similar, depending on version number).
